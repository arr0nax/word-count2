# Word Counter

#### An application to count the repetition of words in a sentence, February 2017

#### By **Clayton Collins**

## Description

This program accepts a sentence and a word, then returns the amount of times that the word occurs in the sentence. It does this by breaking the sentence in to an array by spaces, then iterating through and checking each word to see if it matches the inputed word.  

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _In terminal, navigate to the project directory and run "composer install"_
* _Navigate to the 'web' folder and begin a PHP server (run 'php -S localhost:8000)_
* _open 'localhost:8000' in your web browser_
* _Enter a sentence and a word!_

## Known Bugs

None that I'm aware of. Be careful that inputing multiple words in to the word field will probably result in no matches, since the program removes spaces.
